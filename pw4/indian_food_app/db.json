      "description": "this simple Indian chicken curry is made in the style common to the hamlets in Konkan, along the west coast of India. Using bone-in chicken lends the meat a richer, gamey flavor that's in keeping with how this dish was traditionally made, using free-roaming birds. A heavy hand with spices, including turmeric, coriander, cumin, and cinnamon, plus plenty of chili, leaves this dish intensely flavorful and fiery. Serve it over white rice or with bhakris (a type of unleavened rice bread) to soak up all the sauce.",
